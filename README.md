# stim_production.py
* Define directories
* Define variables (duration and percentage of the repeating tones)
* Create a data frame: it starts with generating a baseline list. In the baseline list, there are ***block, unitdur, percentage, stim_code.***
* Add other variables: ***iti, seed*** (you use this seed as a parameter while generating tone clouds. This ensures that all tone clouds in an experimental session are random).
* At that point, by using the values in the table, generate signals. 
* To generate signals, you use a function called gencloudcoherence. It takes change_dictionary as an input. The output of the functions are the signal itself (y) and the parameters of the tone clouds (sP). You can find more detailed information in the part where I explain the function itself. 
* Give each signal a name. Store the name of the audio signals in the table.
* Write the signal as wav files.
* Extract values from sP dictionary and add them as new columns to table values.
* Calculate signal length and the stimulus duration values. Attach these values to the data frame as new columns. 
* Lastly, calculate the maximum inter stimulus interval and attach it to the data frame.
* In the end we have the following columns: ***block, unitdur, percentage, stim_code, iti, seed, stim_name, lowf, highf, fstep, timestep, tonedur, nrep, rtime, fs, signal_length, stim_duration, isi***

# experiment_params.py
* Stimulus related parameters:
  * Duration
  * Repeating percentage of the tones
* Number of blocks
* Inter trial interval (iti)
* Output column names → ***participant_id, time, block_idx, trial_idx, tapping_file_name, stim_code, unitdur, percentage***
* Audio parameters

# stimulus_params.py
* Low frequency 
* High frequency
* Frequency step
* Time step
* Tone duration
* Unit duration
* Number of repetition
* Percentage
* Seed
* Rise time
* Sampling frequency

# tone_cloud_production.py
This function generates tone clouds stimulus with specified frequency and time perturbations and repeated tones. It ensures reproducibility with a random seed and allows customization through parameter changes. The generated signal is normalized and padded to avoid clipping and ensure proper alignment.

# ramp_function.py
The psyramp function is designed to apply a cosine-squared ramp (fade-in and fade-out) to a signal x. This can be useful in audio processing to smoothly transition the start and end of a signal to avoid abrupt changes, which can create clicks or other unwanted artifacts. 

# data_frame_functions.py
import this as dff
1. **Generate_baseline_table:** This function generates a list of trial conditions for an experiment based on provided parameters. It creates combinations of unit durations and repetition percentages, assigns a specific stimulus code for each combination, and specifies expected responses.
2. **get_df(table_name, table_dir):** to read a tab-separated values (TSV) file into a Pandas DataFrame and return both the DataFrame and the number of rows (trials) it contains.
3. **check_consecutive_occurrences(array):**
4. **pseudorandomize_and_save_df(df, which_block, exp_info, table_dir):**
5. **save_output_df(output, experiment_mark, which_block, data_dir):** The function saves the provided output data to a file in a specified directory. The file is named based on the block number and experiment mark, and the data is saved in a tab-separated format without row indices.
